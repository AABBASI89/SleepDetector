# SleepDetector
This GUI uses a simple motion detection algorithm to detect the duration of stillness in .avi video files. 
We use this measure of stillness to get the sleep duration for a recording session. 
This GUI generates .mat file in the same folder as the analyzed video file. 
The .mat file contains motion trace and total sleep duration.
